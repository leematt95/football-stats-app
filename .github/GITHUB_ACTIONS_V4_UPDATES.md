    cache-dependency-path: 'requirements.txt'  # ⚡ Faster builds
```

### **2. Concurrency Control**
```yaml
# Cancel previous workflow runs for the same branch
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true  # 🚀 Saves resources
```

### **3. Manual Workflow Triggering**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:  # 🎯 Manual trigger capability
```
